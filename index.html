    <h1>No Man Is An Island</h1>
    <h2>by John Donne</h2>
    <p>No man is an island,<br>
Entire of itself,<br>
Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
A part of the main.<br>
If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
Europe is the less.<br>
As well as if a promontory were.<br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
Or of thine own were:<br>
Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;</p>
It tolls for thee.<br>
